#### Authorized functions and macros

------------


write (man 2 write)
malloc (man 3 malloc)
free (man 3 free)
va_start (man 3 va_start)
va_end (man 3 va_end)
va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
va_arg (man 3 va_arg)

------------

#### Compilation

------------



The code must be compiled this way:

**$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c**

As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a main function in the root directory of your project (you could have a test folder containing all your tests files including main functions)

The main files will include your main header file (holberton.h): **#include holberton.h**
